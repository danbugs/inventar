# Hello, there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Inventar!

Inventar is an app designed to help you keep track of your things (i.e., inventory them) be it while you are moving or, really, just in general â€” for some, it can even aid sustain a minimalistic lifestyle!

Inventar was developed with Svelte for the front-end and with Rust (Rocket ðŸš€ + Diesel â›½) for the back-end.

All the data stored in the app is being hosted on the free-tier of a cloud-based PostgreSQL database provider (see [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/)), which supports a maximum of 5 concurrent connections and 20MB of data maximum.

## How I Setup the DB

1) Install `diesel` cli w/ postgres specifications: `cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres`
2) Create a `.env` file specifying a `DATABASE_URL` as per `.env.example` file.

> Note: Your `DATABASE_URL` should look somewhat like: `postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>/<database_name>`

> Check out [Diesel's Getting Started Guide](https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started) for more info on setup and next steps (i.e., migrations and whatnot).

## How I Deployed on Heroku

1) Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
2) In your command-line, log into Heroku (`heroku login`).
3) Now, on Heroku's dashboard, create a new app.
4) In your existing Rust project, run `heroku buildpacks:set emk/rust`
5) Check out my `Procfile` and `rust-toolchain` files â€” that's also needed ðŸ‘Œ.
6) To finish off, if you want to avoid having to push to the Heroku remote all the time, go to the your app's deployment settings and connect to your GitHub repo â€” we're done! Now, whenever you push to `main/master`, you'll be deploying to Heroku!

## How to run this project locally

- For the front-end, make sure you're in the sub-root inventar folder and run: `npm run dev`.
- For the back-end, make sure you're in the root inventar folder and run: `cargo run` or `cargo watch -x run` (i.e., if you use cargo watch).
